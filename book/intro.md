# *Using QIIME 2*

**Make QIIME 2 work for you.**

```{admonition} Development status of this content
:class: note
*Using QIIME 2* is in an early stage of development, and as a result the documentation at https://docs.qiime2.org is still your best source for learning to use QIIME 2.
Over the next few months (as of 16 September 2024), existing content will be migrated and new content will developed, and ultimately *Using QIIME 2* will replace all content at https://docs.qiime2.org.
While *Using QIIME 2* is in development, some URLs may change.

You can find some details on the plan for the development of *Using QIIME 2* [here](https://develop.qiime2.org/en/latest/docs/user-documentation.html).

The canonical URL for this project is https://use.qiime2.org.
```

The content in each part of this book is organized under the [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework {cite}`diataxis`, which organizes content into *Chapters* containing *Tutorials*, *How-To-Guides*, *Explanations*, and *References*.
Each serves a different goal for the reader:

```{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Chapter
  - Purpose

* - Tutorials
  - Provide a guided exploration of a topic for **learning**.

* - How To Guides
  - Provide step-by-step instructions on how to **accomplish specific goals**.

* - Explanations
  - Provide a discussion intended to aid in **understanding** a specific topic.

* - References
  - Provide specific **information** (e.g., a list of utilities available through {term}`q2cli`).

  abstract = "Here we present a standard developed by the Genomic Standards
              Consortium (GSC) for reporting marker gene sequences--the minimum
              information about a marker gene sequence (MIMARKS). We also
              introduce a system for describing the environment from which a
              biological sample originates. The 'environmental packages' apply
              to any genome sequence of known origin and can be used in
              combination with MIMARKS and other GSC checklists. Finally, to
              establish a unified standard for describing sequence data and to
              provide a single point of entry for the scientific community to
              access and learn about GSC checklists, we present the minimum
              information about any (x) sequence (MIxS). Adoption of MIxS will
              enhance our ability to analyze natural genetic diversity
              documented by massive DNA sequencing efforts from myriad
              ecosystems in our ever-changing biosphere.",

              Sample Identifiers for Comparative Omics Studies",
  author   = "Chase, John H and Bolyen, Evan and Rideout, Jai Ram and Caporaso,
              J Gregory",
  abstract = "The number of samples in high-throughput comparative ``omics''
              studies is increasing rapidly due to declining experimental
              costs. To keep sample data and metadata manageable and to ensure
              the integrity of scientific results as the scale of these
              projects continues to increase, it is essential that we
              transition to better-designed sample identifiers. Ideally, sample
              identifiers should be globally unique across projects, project
              teams, and institutions; short (to facilitate manual
              transcription); correctable with respect to common types of
              transcription errors; opaque, meaning that they do not contain
              information about the samples; and compatible with existing
              standards. We present cual-id, a lightweight command line tool
              that creates, or mints, sample identifiers that meet these
              criteria without reliance on centralized infrastructure. cual-id
              allows users to assign universally unique identifiers, or UUIDs,
              that are globally unique to their samples. UUIDs are too long to
              be conveniently written on sampling materials, such as swabs or
              microcentrifuge tubes, however, so cual-id additionally generates
              human-friendly 4- to 12-character identifiers that map to their
              UUIDs and are unique within a project. By convention, we use
              ``cual-id'' to refer to the software, ``CualID'' to refer to the
              short, human-friendly identifiers, and ``UUID'' to refer to the
              globally unique identifiers. CualIDs are used by humans when they
              manually write or enter identifiers, while the longer UUIDs are
              used by computers to unambiguously reference a sample. Finally,
              cual-id optionally generates printable label sticker sheets
              containing Code 128 bar codes and CualIDs for labeling of sample
              collection and processing materials. IMPORTANCE The adoption of
              identifiers that are globally unique, correctable, and easily
              handwritten or manually entered into a computer will be a major
              step forward for sample tracking in comparative omics studies. As
              the fields transition to more-centralized sample management, for
              example, across labs within an institution, across projects
              funded under a common program, or in systems designed to
              facilitate meta- and/or integrated analysis, sample identifiers
              generated with cual-id will not need to change; thus, costly and
              error-prone updating of data and metadata identifiers will be
              avoided. Further, using cual-id will ensure that transcription
              errors in sample identifiers do not require the discarding of
              otherwise-useful samples that may have been expensive to obtain.
              Finally, cual-id is simple to install and use and is free for all
              use. No centralized infrastructure is required to ensure global
              uniqueness, so it is feasible for any lab to get started using
              these identifiers within their existing infrastructure.",

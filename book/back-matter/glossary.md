# Glossary

```{glossary}

action
	A general term for a {term}`method`, a {term}`visualizer`, or a {term}`pipeline`.
  Actions are always defined by QIIME 2 {term}`plugins <plugin>`.

artifact
	Artifacts are QIIME 2 {term}`results <result>` that are generally considered to represent intermediate data in an analysis, meaning that an artifact is generated by QIIME 2 and intended to be consumed by QIIME 2 (rather than by a human).
  Artifacts can be generated either by importing data into QIIME 2 or as out from a QIIME 2 {term}`action`.
  When written to file, artifacts typically have the extension {term}`qza`.
  Artifacts can be provided as input to QIIME 2 {term}`actions <action>` or exported from QIIME 2 for use with other software.

method
	A type of QIIME 2 {term}`action` that takes one or more {term}`artifacts <artifact>` or {term}`parameters <parameter>` as input, and produces one or more {term}`artifacts <artifact>` as output.
  For example, the `filter-features` {term}`action` in the `q2-feature-table` {term}`plugin` is a {term}`method`.

pipeline
	A type of QIIME 2 {term}`action` that typically combines two or more other {term}`actions <action>`.
  A pipeline takes one or more {term}`artifacts <artifact>` or {term}`parameters <parameter>` as input, and produces one or more {term}`results <result>` ({term}`artifacts <artifact>` and/or {term}`visualizations <visualization>`) as output.
  For example, the `core-metrics` {term}`action` in the `q2-diversity` {term}`plugin` is a {term}`pipeline`.

plugin
	A plugin provides analysis functionality in the form of {term}`actions <action>`.
  All plugins can be accessed through all interfaces.
  Plugins can be developed and distributed by anyone.
  As of this writing, a collection of plugins that are installed together are referred to as a distribution.
  Additional plugins can be installed, and the primary resource enabling discovery of additional plugins is the [QIIME 2 Library](https://library.qiime2.org).

q2cli
  [q2cli](https://github.com/qiime2/q2cli) is the original (and still primary, as of March 2024) command line interface for QIIME 2.

qza
	An acronym for **Q*IIME **Z**ipped **A**rtifact.
	See {term}`artifact`.

qzv
	An acronym for **Q*IIME **Z**ipped **V**isualization.
  See {term}`visualization`.

result
	A general term for an {term}`artifact` or a {term}`visualization`.

sample
	An individual unit of study in an analysis.

visualizer
	A type of QIIME 2 {term}`action` that takes one or more {term}`artifacts <artifact>` or {term}`parameters <parameter>` as input, and produces exactly one {term}`visualization` as output.
  For example, the `summarize` {term}`action` in the `q2-feature-table` {term}`plugin` is a {term}`visualizer`.

visualization
	Visualizations are QIIME 2 {term}`results <result>` that represent terminal output in an analysis, meaning that they are generated by QIIME 2 and intended to be consumed by a human (as opposed to being consumed by QIIME 2 or other software).
  Visualizations can only be generated by QIIME 2 {term}`visualizers <visualizer>` or {term}`pipelines <pipeline>`.
  When written to file, visualizations typically have the extension {term}`qzv`.
  See [](view-visualizations) for information on how to view Visualizations.
